# Our Bricks

[![Built with Grunt][gruntbadge]](http://gruntjs.com/)

This repository contains the code for Our Bricks, a community site for
LEGO collectors. I am building this site to gain a better understanding of
the all-JavaScript MEAN stack and API construction. This site is based on a
fork of John Hofrichter's [MEAN-example][jhmean] project.

**This is a work in progress.**
